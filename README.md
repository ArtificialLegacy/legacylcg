* Main Phase 2 - This is the same as your first main phase.
* End Phase - This is the end of your turn and is used in card effects. When a player "ends" their turn this is when this phase starts, you can still trigger defense and counter cards during this time. (End phase ends when both players agree it ends as in they have no cards to play)
